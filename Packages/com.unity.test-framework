If a new test is added in the project the random order passing the same seed will be kept, and the new test will be placed in the random list accordigly.\n- Fix for WebGL platform target to close the browser tab when the run is completed. \n- Added TestFileReferences.json to be generated on build step of the player, so can be consumed later by Test runners to enrich data for run part."
