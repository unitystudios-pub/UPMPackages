  "description": "ZivaRT (Ziva Real Time) is a machine learning technology that allows a user to produce film-quality shape deformation results in real time. In particular, the software takes in a set of representative high-quality mesh shapes and poses, and trains a machine-learning model to learn how to deform and skin the mesh. ZivaRT allows for film-quality characters to be deployed in real-time applications.\n\n",
